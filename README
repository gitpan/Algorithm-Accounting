Algorithm::Accounting provide simple aggregation method to make log
accounting easier. It accepts data in rows, each rows can have many
fields, and each field is a scalar or a list(arrayref).

Besides accounting to single field, Algorithm::Accounting provide
the ability to account groups of field. So one can see the
co-relation of their data.
